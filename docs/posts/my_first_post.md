# First Post

Finally deployed not so sketchy blog.
<!-- more -->

I have tried bunch of solutions, from only using html, css, and javascript to 
using production grade frameworks such as Next.js to create my own blog.
They all failed because it took long time to build and 
I simply don't have the time and dedication to build it. 
I also believe I should focus on the writing not building.
Not that building website is fun, but I get carried away. Hopefully I can finally
write some posts.

For those who are starting out, [mkdocs material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) is simple but powerful way to build documentation, blog and more.
